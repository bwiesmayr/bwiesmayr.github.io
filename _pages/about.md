## This website is unfinished and under construction.

Postdoctoral researcher for model-driven software engineering in industrial automation at the [JKU Linz](https://www.jku.at/lit-cyber-physical-systems-lab/ueber-uns/team/di-dr-bianca-wiesmayr-bsc-mlbt/)

My research interests include the usability of modeling tools, as well as modeling languages for industrial automation (especially IEC 61499 for control software). As a member of the project team of [Eclipse 4diac](eclipse.dev/4diac), I contribute to an open-source infrastructure for distributed industrial automation. For help using this tool, see [this page](/teaching).
