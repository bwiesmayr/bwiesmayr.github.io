collection: publications
category: iec61499
permalink: /publication/journal1
excerpt: 'Although IEC 61499 provides mechanisms for modeling and event-based execution, control software implemented according to IEC 61499 often neglects to fully utilize these potentials. This paper describes a systematic literature review investigating differences between IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499, migration strategies from cyclic code to event-based one, and future research directions for IEC 61499.'
