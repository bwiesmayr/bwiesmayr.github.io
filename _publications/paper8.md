excerpt: 'As a developer of domain-specific languages and their tools, we often have to prioritize the areas we focus on. This maturity model describes decision criteria and important aspects of a mature language ecosystem. As potential users of a domain-specific language, we can use these criteria to evaluate the maturity of the language in question.'
